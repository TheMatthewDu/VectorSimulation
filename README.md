# VectorSimulation
A Vector Simulation Program for simulating Linear Transformations using the 
Python's `numpy` and `pygame` libraries.

To start, select the matrix and vectors you want to simulate in the `__main__` 
block of [`simulation.py`](Simulation.py) and run the program to produce a 
simulation.
